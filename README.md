# BlinkTrack  
Hands-free interaction system enabling cursor control and selection through real-time gaze tracking and blink detection.  
Developed for CS449 – Human–Computer Interaction.

## Overview
BlinkTrack explores a low-cost, webcam-based approach for hands-free interaction.  
The system tracks gaze direction to move the cursor and detects intentional eye blinks (single, double, prolonged) for interaction commands.

## Features (Milestone 1)
- Low-fidelity UI prototypes (Figma)
- Gaze landmark extraction via MediaPipe FaceMesh
- Basic blink detection using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Initial cursor motion experiments via pyautogui
- Study Design Protocol (docs/study_design_protocol.md)
